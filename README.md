# An Example of Markdown Documentation

This is a sample site to demonstrate the functionality of Markdow in Github.

## My 1st topic

This is some text that pertains to my 1st topic. I feel very emphatic about *italics*, but not nearly as much as I feel about going forth **boldly**.

## My 2nd topic

This is some text that pertains to my 2nd topic. in this topic, I'm going to include aome lists.

### Bulleted lists

Here is a bulleted list:

 * The first item
 * And a second one
   * This one is nested
   * And this one too

### Ordered list

Here is an ordered, or numbered list:

1. The first item in this list is numbered one.
2. And another one. Let's see what happens when the text exceeds one line--will it indent when it goes to another line? We'll find out pretty soon; and yes, it does line up with the 1st char after the number and period.

But appanently, you can't do outline numbering. We'll investigate later to confirm that.

### Links

Let's try links now.

[UPMC](www.upmc.com)

OK, that was pretty easy. Text in square brackets display, and then you put the URL in parenthesis. There are several other ways to do links, but I won't do them all right now.
